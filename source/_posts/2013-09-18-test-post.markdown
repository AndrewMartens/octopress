It seems that I've managed to successfully deploy Octopress, and update the styling
a bit.  Not a lot, but I wanted to tweak it a little bit.  Of course, I've probably
completely messed it up for mobile clients, but I'll fix that later.

<!-- more -->

There's lots of things I still need to get working, so I'm going to mess around
with them on this page until I'm happy.

Things still to be done:

## Styling (general):

- see what it looks like without the embossing on the text in the nav bar and footer
- base indentation is screwed up for lists (too far left)
- make sure Disqus is using the same fonts

## Content:

- migrate old content:
    - pages
    - posts
    - image galleries
    - audio
        - https://github.com/soupdiver/octopress-soundcloud
- update outdated content
- add commenting policy (on About page)
- make sure you get all the images for those posts
- and thumbnails of those images
- and the descriptions of those images

## Migration / optimization:

- ensure that links for old posts are properly forwarded to their new locations
(can be done with nginx easily; do I have any other options that would work with Dreamhost?)
- export comments to Disqus
- make Google re-index the site
- improve load times; it's fast enough from localhost but will need to be < 2s on the internet
    - this page is currently (according to Chrome): 47 requests, 597 KB transferred, 1.69 s (load: 1.17 s, DOMContentLoaded: 318 ms)
    - index is: 16 requests, 511 KB transferred, 1.09 s (load: 542 ms, DOMContentLoaded: 251 ms)
    - header image is an offender at 273 kB, maybe I should ditch it in favour of my hex idea

## Images:

- styling: remove frame
- text overlay for images (white or black, larger font, thin lines):
    - sort of ok, but in including the width I probably messed up media queries and this probably breaks with larger images on mobile devices
    - might need a better solution for this (hacked up _blog.scss and added image_overlay_tag.rb)
- captions for images (in attached box below, no frame) - http://blog.zerosharp.com/image-captions-for-octopress/
- credit URL for images (small, right-align, in box)
- lightbox - http://www.rayfaddis.com/blog/2013/08/31/octopress-boostrap-image-modal or http://www.rayfaddis.com/blog/2013/05/27/jquery-validation-with-twitter-bootstrap/

## Blockquotes: OK

{% blockquote Paul Kurtz, The Affirmations of Humanism %}
We affirm Humanism as a realistic alternative to theologies of despair and
ideologies of violence and a source of rich personal significance and genuine
satisfaction in the service to others. We believe in optimism rather than
pessimism, hope rather than despair, learning in the place of dogma, truth
instead of ignorance, joy rather than guilt or sin, tolerance in the place of
fear, love instead of hatred, compassion over selfishness, beauty instead of
ugliness, and reason rather than blind faith or irrationality. We believe in
the fullest realization of the best and noblest that we are capable of as human
beings.
{% endblockquote %}

## Pull quotes: OK

{% pullquote %}
Julia and I went camping in the BC southern interior the week before the May
long weekend. {" The weather was supposed to be clear and increasingly warm "}
– well, it was a few valleys over, where we originally had planned to go
camping. But  on our way there, she suggested we take a particular logging
road, and we went  exploring. After a bit of driving, we located a fantastic
site on the banks of the Similkameen River. I’d tell you where, but telling
The Intarwebs about a great secluded camping spot isn’t exactly the best idea.
Someone else clearly knew about it, since there were a few discarded shotgun
shells, a bit of garbage, and a great stone firepit. The road in is definitely
not RV friendly, but we had a fun time driving down it.
{% endpullquote %}

## Syntax highlighting:

- square corners on top
- remove gradient
- change colour scheme to something else

``` javascript Wakka wakka wakka
function getCluster(cluster, sessions, callback) {
  var query = { sessions: (sessions || false)};
  request.get({
      uri: apiUrl() + 'clusters' + '/' + cluster,
      qs: query
    }, processResponse.bind(null, callback)
  );
}
```
